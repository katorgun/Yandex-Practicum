Welcome to the curated repository showcasing the array of data science projects crafted by Andrei Katorgin. These projects were undertaken as part of the educational journey at Yandex.Praktikum. Each project is meticulously presented through iPython Notebooks and detailed README files in Markdown, offering an in-depth look at my work.
Included are my certificates of course completion:
